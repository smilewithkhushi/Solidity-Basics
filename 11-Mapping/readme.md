# Mapping and Hashing in Solidity

Mappings and hash functions are important concepts in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In this readme, we will explore the syntax, properties, and operations related to mappings and hashing in Solidity.

## Mapping Syntax

Mappings in Solidity are used to create key-value pairs, similar to dictionaries or hash tables in other programming languages. The syntax for declaring a mapping is as follows:

```solidity
mapping(keyType => valueType) mappingName;
```

Here, `keyType` represents the data type of the keys, and `valueType` represents the data type of the corresponding values.

## Mapping Properties

Mappings in Solidity have the following properties:

- Mappings are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- Each key in a mapping is unique.
- Mappings can have any data type as keys and values, as long as they are valid Solidity types.
- Mappings can be of fixed size or dynamic size.

## Mapping Operations

Mappings in Solidity support the following operations:

- **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair into a mapping, you can use the assignment operator (`=`) or the `mappingName[key] = value` syntax.
- **Access**: To access the value associated with a specific key in a mapping, you can use the `mappingName[key]` syntax.
- **Update**: To update the value associated with a specific key in a mapping, you can simply assign a new value to that key.
- **Deletion**: To delete a key-value pair from a mapping, you can use the `delete` keyword followed by the key.

## Learning Pointers

Here are some important pointers to keep in mind while working with mappings and hashing in Solidity:

1. Understand the concept of mappings and how they differ from arrays and structs.
2. Be aware of the data types that can be used as keys and values in mappings.
3. Learn about the limitations and best practices when using mappings in smart contracts.
4. Explore different hashing algorithms available in Solidity and their use cases.
5. Practice writing code examples to solidify your understanding of mappings and hashing.
