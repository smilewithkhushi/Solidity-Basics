## üåü Highlights

### Introduction to Solidity

Learn the fundamentals of Solidity, including how to set up your development environment and write your first smart contract.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HelloWorld {
    string public greet = "Hello, World!";
}
```

### Data Types and Variables

Understand different data types and how to declare variables in Solidity.

```solidity
contract DataTypes {
    uint public myUint = 1;
    string public myString = "Hello";
    address public myAddress = msg.sender;
}
```

### Functions and Modifiers

Explore how to define functions, use function modifiers, and understand their significance.

```solidity
contract Functions {
    uint public myNumber;

    function setNumber(uint _number) public {
        myNumber = _number;
    }

    function getNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return myNumber;
    }
}
```

### Inheritance and Interfaces

Dive into contract inheritance and interface implementation to create more modular and reusable code.

```solidity
contract Parent {
    function sayHello() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "Hello from Parent";
    }
}

contract Child is Parent {
    function greet() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return sayHello();
    }
}
```

### Smart Contract Security

Learn best practices for writing secure smart contracts to prevent common vulnerabilities.

```solidity
contract SecureContract {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

### Design Patterns

Implement common design patterns used in Solidity development, such as the Singleton and Factory patterns.

### Optimization Techniques

Optimize your smart contracts for better performance and lower gas costs.

### Real-world Examples

Study real-world examples to see how Solidity is used in practice.
