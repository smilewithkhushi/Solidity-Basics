# Solidity Function Basics

In Solidity, functions are an essential part of smart contracts. They allow you to define the behavior and logic of your contract. Here are some important points to understand about functions:

## Getter and Setter Functions
Getter functions, also known as "view" functions, are used to retrieve data from the contract without modifying it. They do not consume any gas and are marked with the `view` keyword. Setter functions, on the other hand, are used to modify the contract's state and may consume gas.

## Visibility
Functions in Solidity can have different visibility levels, which determine who can access them. The four visibility levels are:
- `public`: Can be accessed from anywhere, both internally and externally.
- `private`: Can only be accessed from within the contract.
- `internal`: Can be accessed from within the contract and its derived contracts.
- `external`: Can only be accessed externally, i.e., from outside the contract.

## Return Type
Functions can have a return type, which specifies the type of value they return. Solidity supports various data types for return values, including integers, booleans, strings, and custom-defined types.

## Gas Fee
Executing functions in Solidity consumes gas, which is a measure of computational effort. The gas fee associated with a function depends on its complexity and the amount of data it manipulates. It is important to consider gas costs when designing and executing functions to optimize contract performance.


## Difference between `view` and `pure` keywords in Solidity functions

In Solidity, the `view` and `pure` keywords are used to specify the behavior of functions. Here's the difference between them:

- `view`: Functions marked with the `view` keyword are read-only functions that do not modify the contract's state. They can only retrieve data from the contract and return it to the caller. These functions do not consume any gas when called.

- `pure`: Functions marked with the `pure` keyword are even more restricted than `view` functions. They do not read or modify the contract's state, and they also do not access any external contracts or libraries. `pure` functions are used for computations that solely depend on the input parameters and do not require any external data.

Both `view` and `pure` functions are used to optimize contract performance by indicating that the function does not have any side effects. It is important to use the appropriate keyword based on the intended behavior of the function.

Remember to use the `view` keyword for functions that retrieve data and the `pure` keyword for functions that perform computations without any external dependencies.
